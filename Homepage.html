    <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
    <h3>Climate change refers to the long-term shift in average weather patterns and temperatures worldwide, which also impact weather patterns, the oceans, precipitation, ecosystems and the amount of extreme weather events (Clark et al., 2006). While natural factors also affect the Earth's climate, the rapid release of greenhouse gases since the 1800s has led to an average global temperature increase of over 1.5 degrees Celsius. (What Is Climate Change?, 2024). <br><br>Greenhouse gases cause global warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere, as the result of a process called the greenhouse effect. Sunlight warms the Earth, which then radiates heat back out. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide prevent this radiation and heat from the sunlight from escaping into space and instead re-radiates some of it back down, which warms the planet (Climate Change: The Greenhouse Gases Causing Global Warming | Topics, 2023). <br><br>This results in catastrophic effects and natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, and crop failures, and has led to the large increase in the occurrence of said disasters. Greenhouse gases can come from both natural and artificial sources. “Large volumes of important greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are released naturally by volcanoes, forest fires, and the decomposition of organic matter.” Natural systems can also absorb greenhouse gases. For example, carbon dioxide is used by plants for photosynthesis. These repositories of greenhouse gases are called sinks (Clark et al., 2006).</h3>

    <h2>Evidence of Climate Change</h2>
    <h3>The Earth’s climate frequently changes throughout history. Most of these changes are attributed to slight changes in the Earth’s orbit that changes the amount of energy from the sun that reaches the earth. However, the change in the Earth's climate that is currently occurring due to global warming is proceeding at a rate that has not been seen over the past few millennia. <br>This helps us understand that what is currently occurring with the Earth’s climate is not due to a natural cause. Furthermore, ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and mountain glaciers allow us to see the rise in the average amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They show us that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing by 250x more than during eras wher due to natural factors, the climate changed significantly. <br>We also know that the planet’s average yearly temperature has been largely increasing, and that the Earth’s average annual climate has increased by 1.5 degrees celsius. Also, we also know that ocean has been getting warmer, with the top 100 m of ocean having a temperature increase of 0.33 degrees celsius. Lastly, the sea level has been greatly increasing, as the global sea level has risen by 8 inches in just the last century! This is due to factors affected by climate change such as the melting of glaciers, the average increase in ocean temperature. (Evidence, 2024). <br>All of these facts and factors provide evidence of climate change, and prove that the recent global warming is caused by humans. </h3>

    <h2>Impacts and Effects of Climate Change</h2>
    <h3>Climate change affects everyone in the world, but some groups of people are faced with the worse side of the effects of global warming. The IPCC has concluded multiple times that the effects of climate change are worsening and may become far more severe in just a couple of years. They also revealed that 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. In low income and vulnerable countries, the death rate of disasters caused by climate change was 15 times higher than the death rate of disasters in higher income countries. Climate change can also lead to disastrous health effects, such as an increased chance of illness, increasingly frequent extreme weather events, the disruption of food systems, which can lead to starvation and malnutrion, and can make diseases more lethal and dangerous, increases in food, water, and air borne diseases, and climate change can sometimes can lead to mental health issues (Climate Change, 2023). Climate change can also greatly affect the species that live on our planet. Climate change has lead to habitat loss, human wildlife conflict over resources, extinction of species, and large amounts of deaths due to natural disasters caused by climate change.<br> This also leads to a domino effect, as the loss of one species can lead to drastic effects in many species that are connected to it through ecosystems (The Impact of Climate Change on Our Planet's Animals, 2022). For example, the loss of a wolf species may lead to the loss of many plant species as there are no predators to keep the population of herbivores such as deer in check, and this will lead to a large population of deer, which will eat all of the plant species without control, and lead the local extinction of the species. Lastly, climate change will affect humanity economically. Large amounts jobs and careers are dependent of species of animals and plants, such as fishing, and the loss of these species will lead to drastic economic and human loss.<br> Also, natural disasters can lead to billions of dollars of infrastructure loss, which will only increase as climate change becomes more severe. The loss of energy plants, office buildings, homes, and other crucial pieces of infrastructure in cities will be disasterous. Therefore, climate change will have many effects that are far reaching, and it is in everybody’s best interest to help combat climate change. </h3>
